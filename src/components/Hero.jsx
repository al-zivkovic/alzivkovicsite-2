            <p>
                I am a software developer based in Canada, with a passion for building cool software that interests me and provides positive value to others.
                <br />
                <br />
                I'm particularly interested in app development as I've spent a lot of my free time building, designing and testing mobile apps.
                <br />
                <br />
                Coming up with new ideas and productizing them is what I enjoy about software development, not to mention I am an avid pixel pusher and love to get lost the attempt to perfect the visual appearance of my projects.
