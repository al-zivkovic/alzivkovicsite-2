                    I'm a software developer based in Canada, with a passion for building cool software that provides a positive value to others.
                    I'm particularly interested in mobile app development as I've spent a lot of my free time building, designing and testing mobile apps.
                    Iterating and productizing new ideas is what I enjoy most about software development â€” not to mention I love to try and "perfect" the visual design and user experience of my apps.
