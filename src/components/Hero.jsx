                    I am a software developer based in Canada, with a passion for building cool software that interests me and provides positive value to others.
                    I'm particularly interested in app development as I've spent a lot of my free time building, designing and testing mobile apps.
                    Coming up with new ideas and productizing them is what I enjoy about software development, not to mention I love to get lost in the attempt to create a "perfect" visually appealing and functional user interface.
